# Anchore Stereoscope

A Go library for working with container image contents, layer file trees, and squashed file trees.

## Project Overview

Stereoscope is a container image analysis library that provides:
- Parsing and reading images from multiple sources (Docker, OCI, Singularity)
- Building file tree representations for each layer blob
- Creating squashed file tree representations
- Searching file trees for selected paths
- Cataloging file metadata across layers
- Querying underlying image archives for content

## Key Components

- `pkg/image/`: Core image handling for Docker, OCI, and Singularity formats
- `pkg/filetree/`: File system tree operations and utilities
- `pkg/file/`: File metadata, references, and content handling
- `internal/`: Platform-specific clients for Docker, Containerd, and Podman
- `examples/`: Basic usage examples

## Usage

This library is primarily used as a dependency in container security scanning tools and image analysis applications. It provides the foundational layer for tools that need to examine container image contents without running the containers.

## Dependencies

Built with Go 1.24+ and relies on container ecosystem libraries including:
- containerd/containerd for container runtime integration
- docker/docker for Docker daemon interaction
- google/go-containerregistry for OCI registry operations
- sylabs/sif for Singularity image format support

## Development
